# Northcoders News API

## Adding databases:

As .env files are not uploaded to github (because they are in .gitignore), remember to create your own versions of these for each database, each pointing to the respective database e.g. "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test" in .env.test. Locate these in the root directory of the repository.
